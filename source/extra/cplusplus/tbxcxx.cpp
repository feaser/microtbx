/*
 * On a microcontroller it is totally fine to dynamically allocate memory on the heap
 * using new (or malloc). It gets potentially troublesome when you also release it at
 * run-time using delelete (or free). Multiple allocation and release operations can
 * cause memory fragmentation. In a worst case scenario this leads to memory allocation
 * failures, because of running out of heap memory.
 *
 * A possible solution is by dynamically allocating memory using memory pools. This
 * lowers the risk of memory fragmentation. With a carefully selected memory pool setup,
 * you can even eliminate this risk completely. Allowing you to dynamically allocate and
 * release memory during run-time. MicroTBX includes a ready-made memory pool module that
 * can be used for this purpose.
 *
 * One way to approach this is by using C++ "placement new" instead of the usual "new".
 * This allows you the first allocate memory from a memory pool and then place the new
 * object exactly at that memory, instead of having the "new" operator do the allocation.
 * The only issue with this is that there is no "placement delete". This means that to
 * delete the object, you need to manually call its destructor and then give the
 * allocated memory back to the memory pool. Definitely an option, it just requires a bit
 * more work.
 *
 * Another approach is to overload the default "new" and "delete" operators to do all the
 * memory allocation and release using memory pools automatically. That's the purpose of
 * this file. By compiling and linking this source file with your project, the global new
 * and delete operators are overloaded, such that they by default always use the memory
 * pools module of MicroTBX.
