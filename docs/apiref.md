## Types

#### tTbxAssertHandler

```c
typedef void (* tTbxAssertHandler)(char     const * const file,
                                   uint32_t               line)
```

Function type for a run-time assertion handler function.

#### tTbxRandomSeedInitHandler

```c
typedef uint32_t (* tTbxRandomSeedInitHandler)(void)
```

Function type for an application specific seed initialization handler.

#### tTbxList

```c
typedef struct tTbxList
```

Layout of a linked list. Its pointer serves as the handle to the linked list which is obtained after creation of the list and which is needed in the other functions of this module. Note that its elements should be considered private and only be accessed internally by the linked list module.

#### tTbxListCompareItems

```c
typedef uint8_t (* tTbxListCompareItems)(void const * item1, 
                                         void const * item2)
```

Callback function to compare items. It is called during list sorting. The return value of the callback function has the following meaning: `TBX_TRUE` if `item1`'s data is greater than `item2`'s data, `TBX_FALSE` otherwise.

## Functions

### Assertions

More information regarding this software component, including code examples, is found [here](assertions.md).

#### TbxAssertSetHandler

```c
void TbxAssertSetHandler(tTbxAssertHandler assertHandler)
```

Sets the application specific assertion handler. Use macro [`TBX_ASSERT()`](##generic) in your code for assertions.

| Param           | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `assertHandler` | Pointer to the application specific assertion handler to use instead of the default<br>internal handler. The type is [`tTbxAssertHandler`](#ttbxasserthandler). |

### Critical Sections

More information regarding this software component, including code examples, is found [here](critsect.md).

#### TbxCriticalSectionEnter

```c
void TbxCriticalSectionEnter(void)
```

Enter a critical section. Critical sections are needed in an interrupt driven software program to obtain mutual exclusive access shared resources such as global data and certain peripherals. Note that each call to this function should always be followed by a call to [`TbxCriticalSectionExit()`](#tbxcriticalsectionexit). 

#### TbxCriticalSectionExit

```c
void TbxCriticalSectionExit(void)
```

Exit a critical section. Critical sections are needed in an interrupt driven software program to obtain mutual exclusive access shared resources such as global data and certain peripherals. Note that each call to this function should always be preceded by a call to [`TbxCriticalSectionEnter()`](#tbxcriticalsectionenter).

### Heap

More information regarding this software component, including code examples, is found [here](heap.md).

#### TbxHeapAllocate

```c
void * TbxHeapAllocate(size_t size)
```

Allocates the desired number of bytes on the heap. It can be used instead of the compiler specific `malloc()` function. Note that free-ing of allocated memory is not supported to prevent memory fragmentation. If you want to dynamically allocate and release memory, use [memory pools](mempools.md). Note that you configure the overall heap size with macro [`TBX_CONF_HEAP_SIZE`](#configuration) in `tbx_conf.h`.

| Parameter | Description                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `size`    | The number of bytes to allocate on the heap. |

| Return value                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pointer to the start of the newly allocated heap memory if successful, `NULL` otherwise. |

#### TbxHeapGetFree

```c
size_t TbxHeapGetFree(void)
```

Obtains the current amount of bytes that are still available on the heap.

| Return value                      |
| --------------------------------- |
| Number of free bytes on the heap. |


### Memory Pools

More information regarding this software component, including code examples, is found [here](mempools.md).

#### TbxMemPoolCreate

```c
uint8_t TbxMemPoolCreate(size_t numBlocks,
                         size_t blockSize)
```

Creates a new memory pool with the specified number of blocks, where each block has the size as specified by the second function parameter. The required memory is statically preallocated on the heap. This function is typically called one or more times during software program initialization, before the infinite program loop is entered. Once one ore more memory pools were created, the functions [`TbxMemPoolAllocate()`](#tbxmempoolallocate) and [`TbxMemPoolRelease()`](#tbxmempoolrelease) can be called to perform dynamic memory allocation.

A well designed memory pool approach makes dynamic memory allocation possible on RAM constrained microcontrollers, without the need to worry about memory fragmentation. Note that deleting a previously created memory pool is not supported on purpose to prevent memory fragmentation. 

When this function is called to create a memory pool with a size that was already created before, the already existing memory pool is extended instead of creating a new memory pool. This is an important feature because it makes it possible to automatically expand the memory pool if more blocks are needed.

| Parameter   | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `numBlocks` | The number of blocks to statically preallocate on the heap for this memory pool. |
| `blockSize` | The size of each block in bytes.                             |

| Return value                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TBX_OK` if successful, `TBX_ERROR` otherwise for example when there is no more space available on<br>the heap to statically preallocated the blocks. |

#### TbxMemPoolAllocate

```c
void * TbxMemPoolAllocate(size_t size)
```

Attempts to allocate the desired number of bytes in a previously created memory pool. A block will be allocated in a memory pool that best fits the requested byte size. For example, if the following memory pools were created during program initialization:

```c
TbxMemPoolCreate(10, 8);
TbxMemPoolCreate(10, 16);
TbxMemPoolCreate(10, 32);
```

And the following function call is made:

```c
uint8_t * myMem = TbxMemPoolAllocate(9);
```

Then the memory will be allocated from the memory pool with block size 16, so the second memory pool that was created. If there are no more blocks available in that memory pool, then `NULL` is returned. So note that this function does NOT move on to the memory pool with one block size larger. Such a feature would be easy to realize but this design decision was made on purpose.

| Parameter | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `size`    | The number of bytes to allocate in a memory pool. |

| Return value                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pointer to the start of the newly allocated memory if successful, `NULL` otherwise. |

#### TbxMemPoolAllocateAuto

```c
void * TbxMemPoolAllocateAuto(size_t size)
```
An alternative version of  [`TbxMemPoolAllocate()`](#tbxmempoolallocate), which automatically creates  a new memory pool with one block, if one with the exact same blockSize was not yet created. If one with the exact same blockSize was already created, but it's full, then the memory pool is automatically expanded to have one more block.

This offers a convenient way of working with memory pools compared to  [`TbxMemPoolAllocate()`](#tbxmempoolallocate). In addition, it guarantees that it always works on a memory pool where the `blockSize == "size"`. It bypasses the best fitting algorithm used by [`TbxMemPoolAllocate()`](#tbxmempoolallocate), which looks for an existing memory pool with a `blockSize >= "size"`.

For example, to allocate two blocks of 32 bytes using memory pools, all you need to do is:

```c
uint8_t * myMem[2];

myMem[0] = TbxMemPoolAllocateAuto(32);
myMem[1] = TbxMemPoolAllocateAuto(32);
```

Note that there was no need to first create this memory pool with a call to [`TbxMemPoolCreate()`](#tbxmempoolcreate). During the first call to `TbxMemPoolAllocateAuto()`, the memory pool with a block size of 32 bytes was automatically created, including adding one block of 32 bytes to it, which was immediately allocated. During the second call to `TbxMemPoolAllocateAuto()`, another block of 32 bytes was automatically added to the existing memory pool and the newly added block was immediately allocated.

| Parameter | Description                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `size`    | The number of bytes to allocate using a memory pool. |

| Return value                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pointer to the start of the newly allocated memory if successful, `NULL` otherwise. |

#### TbxMemPoolRelease

```c
void TbxMemPoolRelease(void * memPtr)
```

Releases the previously allocated block of memory. Once the memory is released, it can be allocated again afterwards with function [`TbxMemPoolAllocate()`](#tbxmempoolallocate). Note that this function automatically finds the memory pool that the memory block belongs to.

| Parameter | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `memPtr`  | Pointer to the start of the memory block. Basically, the pointer that was returned by<br>function [`TbxMemPoolAllocate()`](#tbxmempoolallocate), when the memory was initially allocated. |

### Random Numbers

More information regarding this software component, including code examples, is found [here](random.md).

#### TbxRandomNumberGet

```c
uint32_t TbxRandomNumberGet(void)
```

Obtains a random number.

| Return value                                |
| ------------------------------------------- |
| Value of the newly generated random number. |

#### TbxRandomSetSeedInitHandler

```c
void TbxRandomSetSeedInitHandler(tTbxRandomSeedInitHandler seedInitHandler)
```

Sets the application specific function that should be called when the seed for the random number generation should be initialized. The actual seed value is not really important, as long as it is a value that is different every time the software program runs, so after each reset event.

Here are a few different approaches that could be implemented to realize an seed value that is different each time the software program runs: 

1. Keep one of the analog inputs on your microcontroller unconnected. Such a floating analog input picks up noise from the surrounding environment and readings will therefore always vary slightly. Configure your ADC peripheral to perform an analog to digital conversion of this analog input and use its result value to seed the generator.

2. If your microcontroller has EEPROM or a non-volatile register, you can use it to store a value that you use to seed the generator. Then simply increment its value by one upon software program startup. This way you have a different seed value every time your software program is started. Keep in mind though that these data storage options have a limited amount of write cycles. A better option might be to use external FRAM.

3. If your microcontroller has access to an external file system such as an SD-card, you could store a value, which you use to seed the generator, in a file. Then simply increment its value by one upon software program startup. This way you have a different seed value every time your software program is started.

4. If your microcontroller based system features a battery backed real-time clock, you could use the current date/time value to seed the generator algorithm.

| Parameter         | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `seedInitHandler` | Pointer to the application specific seed initialization handler to use instead of the<br>default internal handler. If is of type [`tTbxRandomSeedInitHandler`](#ttbxrandomseedinithandler). |
